## Introduction 
Jenkins is an open-source automation server widely used for building, testing, and deploying applications. Automating the setup of Jenkins using Ansible ensures consistency, repeatability, and efficiencyâ€”especially in infrastructure as code (IaC) environments. This guide provides a structured approach to install and configure Jenkins via an Ansible role.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement                 | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Linux Server               | Target machine should be Ubuntu 20.04+ or a compatible Debian-based system.|
| Ansible                    | Installed on the control node (your local system or Ansible server).        |
| SSH Access                 | Ensure passwordless SSH access to the managed node(s).                      |
| Sudo Privileges            | Required for installing packages and managing services on the target host. |
| Java (OpenJDK 17+)         | Needed to run Jenkins. It will be installed via Ansible.                    |
| Internet Connectivity      | Required on the target machine to fetch Jenkins and Java packages.         |
| Inventory Configuration    | Target host must be defined in Ansible inventory under `jenkins_servers`.  |

## Jenkins Setup Using Ansible Roles Steps
### 1. Create Ansible Role Structure
`jenkins_setup_projects/roles` in this directory, 
```bash
ansible-galaxy init jenkins_setup
```
![jenkinsrole4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/479ebb79-844a-4043-9456-20f2ab5084a0)
![jenkinsrole](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b6902ff-eb08-4f7d-af8b-e4682062496d)

### 2. Define Role Files
`roles/jenkins_setup/tasks/main.yml`
```bash
---
- name: Update apt cache
  apt:
    update_cache: yes

- name: Install Java
  apt:
    name: openjdk-17-jdk
    state: present
  become: yes

- name: Download Jenkins GPG key
  get_url:
    url: https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
    dest: /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc
    mode: '0644'
  become: yes

- name: Add Jenkins repository using Jinja2 template
  template:
    src: jenkins.repo.j2
    dest: /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list
  become: yes

- name: Update apt cache
  apt:
    update_cache: yes
  become: yes

- name: Install Jenkins
  apt:
    name: jenkins
    state: present
  become: yes

- name: Start and enable Jenkins service
  systemd:
    name: jenkins
    state: started
    enabled: yes
  become: yes

- name: Ensure Jenkins system user exists
  user:
    name: jenkins
    shell: /bin/bash
    state: present
  become: yes
```
`roles/jenkins_setup/templates/jenkins.repo.j2`
```bash
deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/
```

### 3. Create Ansible Playbook in Project Directory
`jenkins_setup_projects/jenkins-setup.yml`
```bash
- hosts: webservers
  become: yes
  roles:
    - jenkins_setup
```

### 4. Run the Playbook
```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini jenkins-setup.yml
```
![jenkinsrole2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/725e4772-b3d5-493d-bb4a-bbc2610d974f)

### 5. Check Whether the Jenkins is Downloaded 
```bash
sudo systemctl status jenkins
```

## Best Practices for Jenkins Setup with Ansible

| Best Practice                           | Why It Matters                                                                 |
|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Use Role-Based Structure**           | Promotes reusability, modularity, and clean separation of logic.               |
| **Keep Variables in `defaults/` or `vars/`** | Centralizes configuration, making the role easy to customize and reuse.         |
| **Use Templates for Config Files**     | Enables dynamic configuration based on inventory or variable values.           |
| **Avoid Hardcoded Values**             | Enhances flexibility across environments (dev, stage, prod).                   |
| **Enable `become: yes` Carefully**     | Ensure sudo access is only granted where absolutely necessary.                 |
| **Run Idempotent Tasks**               | Ansible tasks should be repeatable without changing state unnecessarily.       |
| **Tag Your Tasks**                     | Allows running specific parts of the playbook using `--tags` for flexibility.  |

## Conclusion
Using Ansible roles to install Jenkins simplifies the process and brings automation, consistency, and version control to your CI/CD infrastructure. This method is scalable and ideal for enterprise-level deployments where repeatable and automated provisioning is essential.
